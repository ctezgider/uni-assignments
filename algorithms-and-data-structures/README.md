### **Algorithms and Data Structures**
Implementations and exercises covering core algorithmic foundations:
- Sorting algorithms  
- Heaps, trees, and balanced structures  
- Hashing  
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, shortest paths)  
- Complexity and runtime considerations

Everything here follows the standard classical approach used in computer science education.
